# Atom Time Tracker

With all things Atom, the goal is to create an open-source, free to use tool that addresses only the most basic of needs.

Atom Time tracking is no different.  After leading everything from large enterprise consulting engagements, to startups with you and a few close friends, you inevitably find your self at the point that you need to do some form of time accounting.  There are a ton of tools on the market for timesheets, why would create yet another one?  When running a small and nimble team of highly skilled and creative individuals, that last thing we wanted to do is demand everyone track their time down to the 15-minute interval, but at times you still find management requiring something from you.  

Our approach is not tracking hours at all, but to allow each member to select their unit of chose, and then compute a relative time spend by each person on each project.  Letting each person operate on how they work best, and can still generate those beloved KPIs to management.

# Requirements

I am running this with Azure Web Apps, and Azure SQL.  This is the only way I am going to test this code; your mileage may vary.
